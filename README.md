# Clipboard-Copied-String-Formalizer

# reason why I made this
I read pdf and epub format book on my computer, I also take notes while I read,
however, when I tried to copy text from pdf book, then paste it to google doc,
the text all jamed together. All paragraphs are pasted as one paragraph, and there were plenty extra spaces pasted as well. 
It costs a lot of time to separate each paragraphs. 
I found one manual solution to this problems:
1. TO Paste the text to the broser link area, then copy from there then paste it to google doc.
However, once it's pasted to the google doc, the space will disapear, but all paragraph jammed together.
2. I had to manually seperate paragraphs. 

Therefore, I tested with python and wrote this program to solve this issue for convenience. 
This will save my time taking notes


# how to use it
After running the program, you will be able to copy text from pdf, web, epub or anyother place,
and paste it to place like google doc or text editor without worring about extra empty space or paragraph jammed together.
(at least pdf to google doc)
You can still copy paste image as usual even if the program is running.
